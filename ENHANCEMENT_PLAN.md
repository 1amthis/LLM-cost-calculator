# Enhanced LLM Cost Calculator: Dynamic Usage Patterns

## New Features to Add:

### 1. **Usage Strategy Mode** (New Tab/Section)
- Add a third calculation mode: "Strategy Mode" alongside Standard and Budget modes
- Allow users to define multi-model usage strategies over time
- Support percentage-based allocation between models (e.g., 70% GPT-4o-mini, 30% Claude Haiku)

### 2. **Time-Based Model Switching**
- **Budget Phases**: Switch models when budget thresholds are reached
- **Performance Phases**: Start with premium models, downgrade when needed  
- **Seasonal Planning**: Different models for different periods (daily/weekly/monthly cycles)

### 3. **Smart Recommendation Engine**
- **Hybrid Strategies**: Recommend optimal model combinations based on budget constraints
- **Cost-Performance Optimization**: Suggest when to use expensive vs. cheap models
- **Break-even Analysis**: Show at what usage volume it makes sense to switch models

### 4. **New UI Components**
- **Strategy Builder**: Visual interface to create multi-model usage plans
- **Timeline Visualization**: Chart showing cost progression over time with model switches
- **Threshold Alerts**: Visual indicators for budget limits and optimal switching points

### 5. **Enhanced Analytics**
- **Usage Pattern Analysis**: Show cost trends across different strategies
- **What-if Scenarios**: Compare multiple strategies side-by-side
- **Budget Utilization Tracking**: Real-time budget consumption with projections

## Implementation Approach:
1. Add new Strategy Mode toggle and UI components
2. Create strategy calculation functions for multi-model scenarios
3. Build visual strategy builder with drag-and-drop model allocation
4. Implement timeline charts showing cost evolution
5. Add recommendation algorithms for optimal model switching
6. Create comparison views for different strategies

This enhancement will transform your calculator from static cost comparison to dynamic usage planning tool that reflects real-world LLM usage patterns.
